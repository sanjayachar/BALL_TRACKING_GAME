# Ball Tracking Game using C and OpenGL

## Overview

This is a simple ball tracking game implemented in C programming language with the use of the OpenGL graphics library. The game involves tracking a ball's movement and responding to user input. This project serves as an interactive and educational example of game development using low-level programming and graphics APIs.

## Features

- **Ball Movement:** The ball moves within the game window, responding to user input or predefined patterns.
- **User Interaction:** Players can control the ball's movement using keyboard input or other input devices.
- **Graphics Rendering:** Utilizes OpenGL for graphics rendering, providing a visual representation of the game.

## Technologies Used

- **C Programming Language:** The core programming language used for implementing game logic.
- **OpenGL:** A graphics library providing functions for rendering 2D and 3D graphics.
- **Input Handling:** Utilizes platform-specific libraries or APIs for handling user input.
